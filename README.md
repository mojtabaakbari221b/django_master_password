# django_master_password

this package is based on a simple idea, if you are a login as a site admin, Enter any password for each user, you can log in as that user .

## What is its use?
Absolutely clear, when users have a problem with their account and report to you, All you have to do is take their username from them without revealing their password information .

### Don't you think the package is very simple?
definitely yes, it's so simple that I do not even know why I packaged it,
but it's #funny, What better reason than this?
